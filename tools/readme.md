# Audio Tools

This module is a library of tools designed to facilitate, help in debugging and create an easy platform for understanding the results.

There are several tools (each in the configuration of a script in Python) so that, if necessary, it will be possible to pull out the right tool to understand the problem / division of the sound waves.

Familiar Python libraries are used to facilitate the creation of scripts such as:
1. wave (for reading and writing wav files)
2. numpy (for numerical representation)
3. matplotlib (for visualization)
